# CollectionViewSample

Demonstrates problem with Xamarin.Forms CollectionView on iOS. 

On UWP or Android, every time one of the top buttons is clicked, a new line (either a Label or an Entry) will be added to the CollectionView. 

On iOS, the previously added controls jump and disappear and change size, seemingly at random.
